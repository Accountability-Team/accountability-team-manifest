# Accountability Team
Welcome to the accountability team! We are happy you came to look around. You were invited here because someone thinks you have the focus and motivation to become a developer and the people skills to work and learn collaboratively. This manifest describes the basic ideas behind this group and how we do things.

## What we are
We are small groups of developers from around the world who meet more or less regularly for standups. This gives us positive social pressure to stay focused on our goal of becoming professional developers, and is a way to network that is fun and instructive. We aim to have video  conferencing in real time, when possible, and when this isn't possible we find other ways to share our work.


## How it works
### New Members
When someone joins, they
- introduce themselves to the group, and outline their availability, interests and time zone.
- link to a GitHub profile
- fill out the (Standup Scheduler)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ijyBz3_FUEEkQsevgxP70jswVRhlugudPgNDWQjhykk/edit?usp=sharing]
- read this manifest.
- they also get a welcome message from whoever added them, and the message explains all of this.

### How groups form
Groups are self organizing and can form around time zones, technologies or any other criteria. Any one can form a group and anyone can schedule a standup. You can go to as many different standups as you want, and you can run them anyway you want. We have some suggestions on how to run a standup down below, if you want to take a look.

When you join you will be greeted by the community and invited to participate in any upcoming standups. You will also be able to see members availability and interests and you can reach out directly to anyone.

There is no master scheduler assigning people to groups and scheduling standups. You will have to take initiative and find or create a standup. Post to the chanell or reach out to individuals privately, tell them you want to meet and get the ball rolling!

### Who runs this thing?
You do. Make a group, schedule a standup and have fun. Oh, and make suggestions. This is a work in progress and we appreciate your ideas.

The admin team is a bunch of busy volunteers who find value in this sort of thing. If you would like to join the admin team dm @Beta


## How to Scrum Master a meeting
There are no hard and fast rules for running a standup, but here are some tips to keep in mind.

1. Anyone in the group can schedule and invite participants to a standup. Don't be shy! Everyone here has an interest in seeing your work and presenting theire own. 


2. A standup should have someone running it. We call this person  [Scrum Master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master).

3. Whoever runs your standup, here are a few points to keep in mind:
- Don't let any one person monopolize everyones time. Keep each presentation to a time limit and make sure everyone has an opportunity to present their work.

4. A good way to structure presentation is to have each presenter address these three questions:
    - What I worked on since the last stand up ...
    - What challenges or road blocks have I come across ...
       - During this section you can open the discussion to feedback from the rest of the team, if it makes sense to do so.
    - What are my goals are for the next sprint ...
5.  Keeps each meeting to areasonable length. If 
6.  Facilitates any other discussion that comes up.
7.  The Scrum Master can keep (or designates someone to keep) a kanban board on GitHub Projects. Each member has a card which gets an update at each standup. Again, this gives us experience with industry project management tools and best practices, even if it isn't really needed.

8. The most important thing is that the standups serve the needs of the participants. So experiment, and let us know what works for you.


## Goals
I would love to build some tech that makes it easier for members to find people in their time zone and with similar interests. DM me @Joaquin Fox if you are interested in helping with this.
