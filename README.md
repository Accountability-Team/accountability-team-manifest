# Accountability Team 
## Description
We are a group of developers who meet regularly for standups. This gives us positive social pressure to stay focused on our goal of becoming professional developers.

## Rules
- We meet two times a month, on Google Meets
- We use an Agile framework to run our meetings ( see "How we use Agile and Scrum" below)
- Everyone has their video turned on when we meet.
- Everyone does a standup where you will:
  - Share your screen with the group and show us what you have been working on.
  - Discuss roadblocks or difficulties you have come across.
  - Tell us your goals for the next sprint.
- Each presenter takes up to 10 minutes.
- We try to keep meetings to less than an hour in total length.
- Each meeting is run by a Scrum Master ( See "How to Scrum Master a meetiing" below)
- Every member has an equal say in setting procedures and direction for the group.
- Every member participates in
  - slack chat.
  - standups.
  - improving the group.
  - Non participating members will get dropped from the group.  

## How to Scrum Master a meeting
Each team member will take a turn being [Scrum Master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master).
The Scrum Master's main job is to setup and faciliate the stand ups. Here are some points to keep in mind when you are acting as Scrum Master:
-   Keeps each standup to about 10 minutes
-   During each standup, each developer addresses 3 questions:
    - What I worked on since the last stand up ...
    - What challenges or road blocks have I come across ...
       - During this section you can open the discussion to feedback from the rest of the team, if it makes sense to do so.
    - What are my goals for the next sprint ...
-   Keeps each meeting to about an hour
-   Facilitates any other discussion that comes up.
-   The Scrum Master keeps (or designates someone to keep) a kanban board on GitHub Projects. Each member has a card which gets an update at each standup. Again, this gives us experience with industry project management tools and best practices, even if it isn't really needed.


## How we use Agile and Scrum
We use an Agile framework called [Scrum](https://github.com/joaquinfox/accountability-team-manifest/blob/main/README.md) for getting things done. Agile is the most used project management framework in software production. By using Agile we get exposure to industry best practices for team work.
