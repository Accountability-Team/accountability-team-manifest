# Accountability Team
Welcome to the accountability team! We are happy you came to look around. You were invited here because someone thinks you have the focus and motivation to become a developer and the people skills to work and learn collaboratively. This manifest describes the basic ideas behind this group and how we do things.

## What we are
We are small groups of developers from around the world who meet more or less regularly for standups. This gives us positive social pressure to stay focused on our goal of becoming professional developers, and is a way to network that is fun and instructive. We aim to have video  conferencing in real time, when possible, and when this isn't possible we find other ways to share our work.


## How it works
### New Members
When someone joins, they
- introduce themselves to the group, and outline their availability, interests and time zone.
- link to a GitHub profile
- fill out the (Standup Scheduler)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ijyBz3_FUEEkQsevgxP70jswVRhlugudPgNDWQjhykk/edit?usp=sharing]
- read this manifest.
- they also get a welcome message from whoever added them, and the message explains all of this.

### How groups form
Groups are self organizing and can form around time zones, technologies or any other criteria. Any one can form a group and anyone can schedule a standup. You can go to as many different standups as you want, and you can run them anyway you want. We have some suggestions on how to run a standup down below, if you want to take a look.

When you join you will be greeted by the community and invited to participate in any upcoming standups. You will also be able to see members availability and interests and you can reach out directly to anyone.

### Who runs this thing?
You do. Make a group, schedule a standup and have fun. Oh, and make suggestions. This is a work in progress and we appreciate your ideas.

The admin team is a bunch of busy volunteers who find value in this sort of thing. If you would like to join the admin team dm @Beta

## Rules
- We meet two times a month, on Google Meets
- We use an Agile framework to run our meetings ( see "How we use Agile and Scrum" below)
- Everyone has their video turned on when we meet.
- Everyone does a standup where you will:
  - Share your screen with the group and show us what you have been working on.
  - Discuss roadblocks or difficulties you have come across?
  - Tell us your goals for the next sprint?
- Each standup takes up to 10 minutes.
- We try to keep meetings to less than an hour in total length.
- Each meeting is run by a Scrum master ( See "How to Scrum Master a mneetiing" below)
- Every member has an equal say in setting procedures and direction for the group.
- Every member participates in
  - slack chat.
  - standups.
  - improving the group.
  - Non participating members will get dropped from the group.  

## How to Scrum Master a meeting
Each team member will take a turn being [Scrum Master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master).
The Scrum Master's main job is to setup and faciliate the stand ups. Here are some points to keep in mind when you are acting as Scrum Master:
-   Keeps each standup to about 10 minutes
-   During each standup, each developer addresses 3 questions:
    - What I worked on since the last stand up ...
    - What challenges or road blocks have I come across ...
       - During this section you can open the discussion to feedback from the rest of the team, if it makes sense to do so.
    - What are my goals are for the next sprint ...
-   Keeps each meeting to about an hour
-   Facilitates any other discussion that comes up.
-   The Scrum Master keeps (or designates someone to keep) a kanban board on GitHub Projects. Each member has a card which gets an update at each standup. Again, this gives us experience with industry project management tools and best practices, even if it isn't really needed.


## How we use Agile and Scrum
We use and Agile framework called [Scrum](https://github.com/joaquinfox/accountability-team-manifest/blob/main/README.md) for getting things done. Agile is the most used project management framework in software production. By using Agile we get exposure to industry best practices for team work.
