# Accountability Team
Welcome to the accountability team! We are happy you came to look around. You were invited here because someone thinks you have the focus and motivation to become a developer and the people skills to work and learn collaboratively. This manifest describes the basic ideas behind this group and how we do things.

## What we are
We are small groups of developers from around the world who meet more or less regularly for standups. This gives us positive social pressure to stay focused on our goal of becoming professional developers, and is a way to network that is fun and instructive. We aim to have video  conferencing in real time, when possible, and when this isn't possible we find other ways to share our work.


## How it works
### New Members
When someone joins, they
- introduce themselves to the group, and outline their availability, interests and time zone.
- link to a GitHub profile
- fill out the (Standup Scheduler)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ijyBz3_FUEEkQsevgxP70jswVRhlugudPgNDWQjhykk/edit?usp=sharing]
- read this manifest.
- they also get a welcome message from whoever added them, and the message explains all of this.

### How groups form
Groups are self organizing and can form around time zones, technologies or any other criteria. Any one can form a group and anyone can schedule a standup. You can go to as many different standups as you want, and you can run them anyway you want. We have some suggestions on how to run a standup down below, if you want to take a look.

When you join you will be greeted by the community and invited to participate in any upcoming standups. You will also be able to see members availability and interests and you can reach out directly to anyone.

### Who runs this thing?
You do. Make a group, schedule a standup and have fun. Oh, and make suggestions. This is a work in progress and we appreciate your ideas.

The admin team is a bunch of busy volunteers who find value in this sort of thing. If you would like to join the admin team dm @Beta

## Rules
- Be nice. If you are mean, we will remove you from the channel.
- Participate. We decided we wanted a small group of motivated and active members than a big group of sleepers. If you show no signs of life we will remove you from the channel.

## Looking forward
There is tech we can build to improve this experience. If you would like to build something for this project, post it in the slack.
